# burger-log

    This application simulates a customer ordering, being served, and consuming burgers. 
    Enter the name of a burger into the text box to order your burger. It will appear on your screen when it is served, with a button that will allow you to "devour" it. Yum!
    This application was built using node, express, express handlebars, and mysql. 
    A demo vide of the application [can be viewed here](insertlinkhere)
